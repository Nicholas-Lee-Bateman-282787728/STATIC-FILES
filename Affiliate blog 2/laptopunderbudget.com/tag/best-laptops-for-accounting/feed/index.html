										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you&#8217;re an owner of a small business&nbsp;or a&nbsp;huge&nbsp;enterprise, an accounting software is something that every business&nbsp;needs these days. And, when it comes to accounting software, the first name that hits our mind is QuickBooks because it&#8217;s really an&nbsp;easy to use and all-in-one accounting software&nbsp;to manage any type of&nbsp;business. So, are you looking for a&nbsp;laptop for&nbsp;quickbooks to manage your business but&nbsp;not sure which one to get? No problem! Here is a detailed guide to buy the best business laptop for accounting on quickbooks.<span id="more-2254"></span></p>
<p>Buying a laptop for niche specific use is easier than buying a laptop for generic uses and when it comes to buying a laptop exclusively for&nbsp;one accounting&nbsp;software, sifting and selecting&nbsp;the best laptop becomes a lot more easier.</p>
<p>All you need to do is check the system requirements recommended by&nbsp;Intuit QuickBooks and pick the laptop with same or better specifications than recommended. Sounds easy. Isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p><em>Well, it is a lot more confusing than you think, keep reading to know why.</em></p>
<p>Here are the minimum hardware specifications recommended for Quickbooks <em>(as listed on their website)</em> &#8211;</p>
<div class="vc_message_box vc_message_box-solid-icon vc_message_box-square vc_color-success">
	<div class="vc_message_box-icon"><i class="fa fa-check"></i>
	</div><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Minimum System Requirements for QuickBooks 2019</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>2.4 GHz processor minimum</li>
<li>4 GB RAM minimum, 8GB RAM Recommended</li>
<li>DVD drive to&nbsp;install quickbooks from CD (Not required if you download quickbooks from Intuit server)</li>
<li>Minimum Display Resolution &#8211;&nbsp;1280 x 1024</li>
<li>2.5 GB of disk space (additional space required for data files)</li>
<li>Wi-Fi / Ethernet for internet access</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>These are the minimum system requirements for Quickbooks for Desktop&nbsp;but quickbooks comes in&nbsp;two different variants. The first one is&nbsp;<strong>QuickBooks for desktop</strong>&nbsp;which we download or&nbsp;install locally from the CD/DVD on our computer and the second one is <strong>Quickbooks online</strong> which we can directly access from the normal internet browser just like any other websites.</p>
<p>Now, the next question that might be hitting your mind right now is &#8211;</p>
<div class="vc_message_box vc_message_box-standard vc_message_box-rounded vc_color-info">
	<div class="vc_message_box-icon"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i>
	</div><h5>Do I need laptop with same specifications as<em> &#8216;<strong>QuickBooks for Desktop</strong>&#8216; </em>to use<em> &#8216;<strong>QuickBooks Online</strong>&#8216;</em>?</h5>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The Answer is </em><strong>NO!</strong></p>
<p>Unlike QuickBooks for Desktop, the&nbsp;QuickBooks Online is actually&nbsp;<a title="What is Software as a Service?" href="http://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/definition/Software-as-a-Service" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">S<em>oftware as a Service (SAAS)</em></a>. So, to access your QuickBooks online account, you just have to sign in on the QuickBooks website from any internet connected device and you&#8217;ll be able to use&nbsp;all the quickbooks features and manage your business from anywhere, anytime.</p>
<p>So to buy <strong>best laptop for&nbsp;QuickBooks online</strong>, you don&#8217;t need to spend much.

Just&nbsp;make sure that it runs web browser perfectly&nbsp;and has the wifi internet connectivity.</p>
</div>

<h3>4. Acer Aspire E 15 E5-576-392H Notebook</h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2IDoLxK" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2351 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/acer-aspire-e-15-e5-575-33bm-156-inch-full-hd-notebook-intel-core-i3-7100u.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire E 15 E5-576-392H 15.6-Inch Full HD Notebook" width="500" height="376"></a>This Acer Aspire laptop will rank higher among the most economical yet high-performing business laptops. That said, <a title="Acer Aspire E 15 (E5-576-392H) Review – The Best Budget Laptop of 2018?" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/acer-aspire-e-15-e5-576-392h-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acer Aspire E 15 E5-576-392H</a>&nbsp;is an affordable, stylish and the most performance oriented laptop in the segment. This laptop caters to a wider audience with its high-performance configuration and other useful features.</p>
<p>It has 1TB of HDD which will let you store all your work files, favorite movies, TV shows and music on this laptop and still you will have plenty of space left to store other things. Business owners and accountants can get uninterrupted quickbooks experience with this laptop because it stays juiced up to 13 hours which will allow you to go a little more productive as the laptop lasts long. While the ones interested in entertainment can go into the woods and enjoy movies, the workaholics can also access some exquisite features of Windows 10 and make their work easier with the long-list of productive softwares on the laptop. The QuickBooks is an addition that will help individuals and professional accountants manage their expenses efficiently.</p>
<p>Well! With the eighth generation Intel core i3 processor and 1TB of HDD the only thing this laptop lacks is a good RAM. Although the 6GB of RAM on this laptop runs quickbooks completely fine, the RAM is not a perfect fit for the core i3 processor and 1TB of HDD, yet considering the budget, it&#8217;s still a steal at the asking price.</p>
<p><em>Note &#8211; This laptop does come with extra RAM slot so you can upgrade the RAM of this laptop.</em></p>

Its performance and long lasting battery are good enough features to enamour businesspeople towards this laptop.</p>
<p>Apple MacBook Pro loses out to competition when it comes to storage space; the 128GB of flash storage in the entry level model is way less when compared to other laptops in the same range but it is way more faster than other contending laptops and it is enough for accounting on quickbooks. The 8GB of RAM can queue a lot of files at the same time for the quad core Intel i5 processor to process and help individuals achieve the much-required efficiency at work. Working on QuickBooks on this laptop is going to be a pleasing experience because of the fluidity that refined macOS offers.</p>
<p>The backlit keyboard with touch bar, its efficient processing power, long-lasting battery life of over 10 hours makes the MacBook Pro a worthy contender by all means.</p>
